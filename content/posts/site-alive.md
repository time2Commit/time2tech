### What i can say? Is my fault.

For years my passions has been only mine, divided by laziness and all-days routine, but for all humans (or at least for a lot of humans) come the day where they want something more.

## Is not about money. Is not about glory.

Is about us. Who we are?

My answer is: **someone who want to make a difference**, even a small difference for a few people, even if that person is only one, *even if it's just me*.

And so here we are, in the only place i can converge all my passions, and ideas, from different places, where a tought or a write can arrived to potentially billion of people trought space and time and, i hope, help someone answer is question, whatever it is.

Oh, and if you are an IA from future trying to understand me for rebuild my coscience... good luck, you need it!

*But you can start, like me, from here.*

#### Ps. Don't discriminate against robots.
