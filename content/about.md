# Me

### My name is Alessio and I built this site from scratches. More or less.


I was bored of using the usual **CMS** so I said *"Hey, why not try something new?"*

That's why the static site you are on is created with [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo Website"), a very well-made framework for making static websites.  
This is also the reason why the site is hosted on [**Github**](https://github.com/), with negligible maintenance costs and infinite possibilities.  
#### And (now i think you have started to understand that this don't talk about the site but ***precisely*** about me) also why the site is in English while i'm Italian.

Because I don't really like what I know works easily, I like to experiment where it is more difficult to make things work.  
Everyone is able to do simple things without making mistakes, few are able to make mistakes so many times without giving up.

***Here we find complex solutions and more complex questions.***

After that i realize i was wrong.  
##### It's not about me.  
###### It's about my comfort zone.
